Here are some good practices that should help the Github page be a bit more consistent.

## Project board

Whenever you hear about a new assignment, even if it's just for you, add it to the _TODO_/_In Progress_ section. While working on a project, try to break it up into 
smaller items that other people can help with and add them all to the _TODO_ section. If you are given a new project, make a new project board.
Whenever you take an assignment out of _TODO_, make sure at least one person is in the 'assignees' section. This way we know who is working on anything at any given 
time. The deadline column is not always needed, but include one if it helps with timing.

## Code section

Upload anything here that you think could be useful for the other people in the lab. Whenever you do upload a project, make sure to write documentation in the wiki 
(or in the project itself if it's fairly small). Missing documentation just leads to useless projects because nobody knows how to use them. 
This can also be a place to share solutions that people outside of the lab could find useful. Make it a codebase for others trying to solve problems similar to ours.

## Wiki

Add anything to the wiki that you feel other RA's could find useful, and add project documentation here. Keep a project's docs to 1 page. 
A good thing to have here would be bug fixes or problems you ran into and how to solve them. Also try to have a page for projects that contains V drive paths, 
supercomputer info, project goals, other teams working on it, etc.

## Questions

Any questions you have should be posted in the teams or issues section here. The teams allows for more of a conversation while the issues section can be tied to 
project board items. I don't currently know a best practice for this so I would love some help in figuring out where we should post (E.S.).

If there are any other questions about the github page, just email me (E.S.).
