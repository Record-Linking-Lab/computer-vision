# computer-vision

This is the repository for the computer vision team at BYU's record linking lab. The goals of this lab are to grow the family tree and help family history work 
via AI. We use Detectron2 and other models to automatically extract information from historical documents.

See CONTRIBUTING.md for adding to this repository and the Wiki for our knowledge base.
